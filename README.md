# Steam recommendation system

Steam is the largest video game hosting platform in the market with a large caleloge full of games. With access to such a variety of games, sometimes users may feel overwelmed, or feel unsure with where to start, there for it is absolutely vital that both customers new and old are provided with recommendended suitable games that align with their specific preferences. 

Therefore for this project i decided to create a recommendation system for steam games to help users find suitable game recommendations that they would be interested in. My goal for this project is to provide more accurate predictions regarding providing a user with recommendations.

### Executive Summary

For this project the aim is to improve steam's current recommendation system to provide users with much more accurate recommendations.

To solve this problem, i will be creating a content and collaborative based recommendation model that provides video game recommendations to steam users. This project will utlize Steam's API, SteamSpy's API along with data sets sourced from kaggle in order to create a recommendation system.

I took data for this project from Steam's api, Steamspy and two kaggle data sets.

Following that i ran multiple models

Third, you then write what you did on the project that is a bit more technical.
Here you might say that you took data from [here and make it a link to the original data]() and then ran `a list of models you ran here` in your analysis.
Then end with one sentence that picks what your best model was and how it performed.

Lastly, you say in one or two sentences why this matters. 
For example, now as opposed to before this data analysis, you can now predict X better than Y. 

The goal of this project was to create a `regression/classification` model that was able to predict `what you set out to do`.

> If you are able to swap out the text here with what your case example is you will demonstrate the following:
> 1. You get why what you're doing 'matters'
> 2. You are able to take ill defined problems and turn them into something a data scienst can solve
> 3. You show off your analystical and modeling chops.
> 4. You are able to communicate technical things you do.
